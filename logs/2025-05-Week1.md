# LifeOS Development Log (Week 1: May 20 â€“ May 24, 2025)

ðŸ“… Day 1:
- Designed the LifeOS kernel architecture inspired by the Linux kernel layout.
- Defined five key components: Memory Manager, Process Manager, Device Drivers, File System, and System Call Interface.
- Mapped traditional OS subsystems to LLM-based equivalents.
- Finalized the kernel's analogy with traditional operating system roles.
- Built a Linux-style folder structure (boot/, kernel/, mm/, fs/, etc.) for modular development.
- Drafted initial implementation of each subsystem as a Python agent.
- Integrated GPLv3 license and documented the architecture in the README.
