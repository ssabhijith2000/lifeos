# LifeOS

This is not just a productivity tool.
This is a full-stack Operating System for life — and for the next generation of computing with AGI, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).

LifeOS is not an app.
It’s a full-stack operating system for living, thinking, building, and remembering — powered by a model-agnostic LLM core.
