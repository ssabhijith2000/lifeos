# Life Modules (Abstract)

This folder represents conceptual components of the LifeOS kernel that may evolve in later stages.

These modules are not strictly part of the kernel itself, but represent high-level abstractions layered on top of the system, potentially leveraging memory, emotional state, health tracking, and psychological feedback loops.

## Current Status
These are placeholder constructs to be developed once the kernel matures. They are not active agents or runtime modules yet.

## Future Directions
- Design persistent emotional memory handling
- Develop self-reflection loops
- Model psychological states as lightweight processes
- Interface these modules with the syscall layer for intelligent introspection
